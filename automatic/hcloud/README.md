`hcloud` is a command-line interface for interacting with Hetzner Cloud.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the Hetzner Cloud Console at [console.hetzner.cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud/),
    select your project, and create a new API token.
2. Configure the `hcloud` program to use your token:

``` bash
hcloud context create my-project
```

3. Youâ€™re ready to use the program. For example, to get a list of available server
    types, run:

``` bash
hcloud server-type list
```

See `hcloud help` for a list of commands.
