Bootstrap Studio comes with a wide array of built-in tools and components that can be dragged and dropped into the active canvas space where they can immediately build responsive web pages and animated web elements.

Bootstrap Studio is built on top of its proprietary Bootstrap framework that promotes experimentation and seamless exporting of optimized HTML pages that are ready for online deployment. The app comes with a large library of components that can be mixed and matched for the creation of unique, eye-catching and streamlined web pages. This library includes headers, footers, galleries, slideshows, and other basic elements, all accessible and usable as drag-and-drop elements that can be infused into test web pages without even knowing how to code.
